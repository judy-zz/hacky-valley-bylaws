# Section 1.2: Supporting Membership

# Supporting Members privileges and fees vary and are to be determined by the Board of Directors and Full Members during a meeting. Supporting Members privileges and fees must apply for a predetermined period of time. 

# Supporting Members must pay their Supporting Membership Fee at the start of each month. Supporting Members will have a grace period of one (1) month to pay their fee before their membership is revoked unless otherwise instructed by the Board of Directors.

# Article X: Amendments

# I looked over a few other hackerspace by laws and drafted this up. 

# Look it over and make changes as you see fit. I think that it be best if we all worked on writing this. 

# If there are whole sections that you don't like, DO NOT DELETE THEM. Just make a note next to it and whoever wrote that section can take that into consideration. 

# We should all be at least 70% satisfied with these by laws.

# Please, do not point out flaws in the by laws unless you have taking the time to write a solid alternative solution that you've already added to the by laws and can reference when you point out the flaw.
